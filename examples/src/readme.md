# A distributed oracle

In this tutorial, we will show you the basics of actor oriented programming with Darlean by making a distributed oracle to which we can everything we want to know, like "What is the temperature of tomorrow?"
or "How much does a bottle of wine cost?".

* Part 1: [The basics](oracle/1_the_basics) - A basic oracle using virtual actor technology
* Part 2: [Oracle as a Service](oracle/2_oracle_as_a_service) - Service actors to hide implementation details from the application
* Part 3: [Do not forget](oracle/3_do_not_forget) - Persistence to remember learned facts
* Part 4: [Scale it up!](oracle/4_scale_it_up) - Transform into a client-server setup with multiple server applications for unmatched scalability and availability
